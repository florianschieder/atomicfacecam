# Atomic Face Cam

Atomic Face Cam is a tiny Windows application for screencasts. It is useful in case you are just out for a
simple screencast without much postprocessing but still want to show your face on the resulting video.

It is a yet stable, standalone application and should compatible with most Windows versions.

## Roadmap

- Automate build process
- Add-ons: custom frames, effects etc.
- Features: hide into tray, reposition the overlay manually by mouse dragging, ...
